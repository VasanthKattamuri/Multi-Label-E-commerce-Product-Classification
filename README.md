# Multi-Label-E-commerce-Product-Classification
This project focuses on classifying e-commerce product descriptions into multiple categories using machine learning models. The goal is to accurately assign relevant categories to products based on their descriptions, which is crucial for improving searchability and organization in e-commerce platforms.

Project Overview
Objective: Classify e-commerce product descriptions into multiple categories using machine learning techniques.
Dataset: A dataset of over 50,000 product descriptions with multiple labels.
Tools Used: Python, Google Colaboratory, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable).
Techniques: Text mining, data transformation, multi-label classification, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
Outcome: Achieved 92% accuracy in classifying products into appropriate categories.

Problem Statement
E-commerce platforms often deal with large volumes of products that need to be categorized accurately for better searchability and user experience. Manual categorization is time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates the process by using machine learning to classify products into multiple categories based on their descriptions.

Approach
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the text data (removed stopwords, punctuation, and performed tokenization). Applied text vectorization techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe). Handled multi-label encoding using techniques like Binary Relevance or Label Powerset.

Model Development: Implemented machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for multi-label classification. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

Model Optimization: Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV. Used cross-validation to ensure model robustness and avoid overfitting.

Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Achieved 92% accuracy in classifying products into the correct categories.

Key Features
Text Mining: Extracted meaningful features from product descriptions.
Multi-Label Classification: Handled the challenge of assigning multiple labels to each product.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model performance through systematic parameter tuning.
Cross-Validation: Ensured the model's generalizability and reliability.
Results
Achieved 92% accuracy in classifying products into appropriate categories. Improved searchability and organization of e-commerce products. Demonstrated the effectiveness of text mining and machine learning in automating e-commerce tasks.
